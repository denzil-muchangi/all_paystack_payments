# Security and PCI DSS Compliance

## Overview

The `all_paystack_payments` Flutter plugin provides a secure interface for integrating Paystack payment services into Flutter applications. This document outlines the plugin's approach to PCI DSS compliance, data handling practices, and security measures implemented to protect sensitive payment information.

## PCI DSS Compliance Statement

The `all_paystack_payments` plugin achieves PCI DSS compliance by leveraging Paystack's Level 1 PCI DSS certified payment infrastructure. The plugin itself does not store, process, or transmit sensitive payment data directly. Instead, it acts as a secure bridge that delegates all payment processing to Paystack's compliant systems.

**Compliance Level**: The plugin inherits Paystack's PCI DSS Level 1 certification, which is the highest level of compliance available. Paystack maintains this certification through regular audits and security assessments.

**Scope**: This plugin is considered "out of scope" for PCI DSS requirements as it does not handle cardholder data. All sensitive payment information is immediately tokenized and forwarded to Paystack's secure servers.

## Data Handling

### Sensitive Data Flow

1. **Input Collection**: Payment data (card details, bank information, mobile money details) is collected through the plugin's UI components or direct API calls.

2. **Immediate Tokenization**: Upon collection, sensitive data is sent directly to Paystack's tokenization service. The plugin never stores raw payment data locally.

3. **Token Exchange**: Paystack returns a secure token that represents the payment method. This token is used for all subsequent payment operations.

4. **No Local Storage**: The plugin does not persist any sensitive payment information on the device or in application storage.

### Data Transmission

- **Encryption**: All communication with Paystack APIs uses HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ with certificate pinning where supported by platform SDKs.
- **Platform-Specific Handling**: Data transmission methods vary by platform but always prioritize security:
  - Mobile platforms use native SDKs with built-in security features
  - Web platform uses Paystack's secure inline.js library
  - Desktop platforms use HTTP APIs with proper certificate validation

## Security Features

### Tokenization
- All sensitive payment data is immediately converted to non-sensitive tokens
- Tokens are single-use or limited-use depending on the payment method
- Raw card data never touches the application or plugin code

### Input Validation
- Client-side validation using regex patterns for card numbers, expiry dates, and CVV
- Server-side validation enforced by Paystack's APIs
- Prevention of common injection attacks through proper data sanitization

### Encryption
- In-transit encryption using TLS 1.2+ for all API communications
- Platform-specific encryption where applicable (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain for temporary storage if needed)

### Authentication and Authorization
- Secure API key management with environment variable support
- OAuth 2.0 integration for authenticated payment flows
- Proper session management for recurring payments

### Error Handling
- Secure error messages that don't expose sensitive information
- Proper logging that excludes payment data
- Graceful failure handling without data leakage

## Developer Responsibilities

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **API Key Security**:
   - Store Paystack public and secret keys securely
   - Use environment variables or secure key management systems
   - Never hardcode keys in source code or version control

2. **Data Minimization**:
   - Only collect necessary payment information
   - Implement proper data retention policies
   - Clear any temporary data after payment completion

3. **Secure Integration**:
   - Validate all payment responses from the plugin
   - Implement proper error handling and user feedback
   - Use the latest plugin version with security updates

4. **Compliance Maintenance**:
   - Stay informed about PCI DSS updates and requirements
   - Conduct regular security assessments of your application
   - Report any security incidents immediately

### Code Security Best Practices

```dart
// Example: Secure API key handling
class PaymentService {
  static const String _publicKey = String.fromEnvironment('PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY');

  // Never expose sensitive data in logs
  void processPayment() {
    try {
      // Payment processing logic
    } catch (e) {
      // Log error without sensitive data
      print('Payment failed: ${e.toString()}');
    }
  }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Android (SDK Integration)
- Uses Paystack Android SDK with built-in PCI compliance
- Implements certificate pinning for API communications
- Leverages Android Keystore for temporary secure storage if needed
- Supports Google Pay integration with tokenization

### iOS (SDK Integration)
- Uses Paystack iOS SDK with PCI DSS compliance
- Implements App Transport Security (ATS) for secure connections
- Uses iOS Keychain for secure temporary storage
- Supports Apple Pay with proper tokenization

### Web (Inline.js Integration)
- Uses Paystack's secure inline.js library
- All payment data is handled within Paystack's iframe
- No sensitive data passes through application JavaScript
- Supports 3D Secure authentication flows

### Desktop Platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS - HTTP API)
- Uses Paystack REST APIs with proper TLS encryption
- Implements certificate validation and pinning
- No local storage of sensitive data
- Supports all payment methods through secure API calls

## Best Practices

### Application Security
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate user input before processing
2. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure all payment-related communications use HTTPS
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep the plugin and all dependencies updated
4. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for payment activities
5. **Testing**: Use test keys in development and staging environments

### Payment Flow Security
1. **One-Time Tokens**: Use tokens immediately and discard after use
2. **Secure Redirects**: Implement proper redirect handling for 3D Secure
3. **Error Handling**: Provide user-friendly errors without exposing sensitive data
4. **Session Management**: Implement proper session timeouts for payment flows
